# Connect4

Here I have essentially the same Connect Four project written in two different programming languages: Python and Scala. 
The projects allow you to play a console version of Connect Four against an AI that has three difficulty levels. 
The AI uses mini max with alpha beta pruning to search for moves. 
The diffulty is determined by the depth of the search.
